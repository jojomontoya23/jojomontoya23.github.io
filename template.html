        <h1>Good morning this is Walter Hardwell White I'm writing this well You want the truth? Fine. I did it. Every cook, every deal, every life that got in my way—me. I wasn’t protecting my family. That’s what I told myself. But the truth is, I did it because I was good at it. I was alive. And I won. So if you’re looking for some kind of confession, there it is. I made my choices. And I’d do it all again</h1>
