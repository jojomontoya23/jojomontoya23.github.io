    <h1>Internet Memes</h1>
    <p>The Internet is a vast space where people share funny images and videos, often with captions, that many find entertaining.</p>

    <h2>My Favorite Video on the Internet!</h2>
    <p>Recently, I came across this video. It caught me off guard—it was messed up, but I couldn't help but laugh. I'm not sure if it's real!</p>

    <h2>Prime Vines</h2>
    <p>Vine was a popular app from 2015 where people made short, funny skits—kind of like TikTok today. I have a strong connection to Vine because I used to watch compilations of the best ones on YouTube almost daily.</p>
