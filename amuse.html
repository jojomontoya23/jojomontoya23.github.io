 <h2>Prime Vines</h2>
        <p>There is an old app from 2015 called Vine where people would make short skits that were funny, and people could upload them to the internet, kind of like TikTok: <a href="https://vine.co/"</a> I have a strong connection to this app due to a lot of compilations that were uploaded to YouTube, and I would almost watch them every day.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI2uGmdzhzw" target="_blank">Best Vines Compalation</a> this video is packed with all the best vines:</p>
