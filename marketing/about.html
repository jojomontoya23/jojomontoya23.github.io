      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>Chick-fil-A is a family-owned, values-driven fast food restaurant known for its original chicken sandwich and commitment to service. Founded in 1967 by S. Truett Cathy, the brand has grown to become one of the largest and most respected quick-service chicken restaurants in the United States.</p>

      <h2>Our Values</h2>
      <p>We strive to serve high-quality food with genuine hospitality. Our core values include integrity, excellence, and care for our communities. We are closed on Sundays to provide our team members a day to rest and spend time with family and friends.</p>

      <h2>Giving Back</h2>
      <p>Chick-fil-A supports local communities through scholarships, food donations, and youth programs. Our goal is not only to serve meals, but to make a meaningful impact wherever we are located.</p>
